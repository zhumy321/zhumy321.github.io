## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE & COURSE PROJECTS	

### Intelligent Sensor System Chip Lab, Shenzhen University                  
Research Assistant, Aug. 2021- Present
•	Learning the basic skills necessary for effective sciences, including academic paper digest, experiment design, data collection and recording, experimental results interpretation, and academic writing training
•	Studying and working with the graduate students in the lab, simultaneously preparing for the graduation project
•	Assisting lab mates in the design and testing of laboratory projects

### 6T SRAM Design based on TSMC65nmLP 
July. 2021
Project Leader; Supervised by Prof. Xiaojin Zhao, Shenzhen University
•	Learned the principle of SRAM and drew it with virtuoso
•	Understood how the decoder, amplifier circuit, pre-charge circuit cooperate with 6T SRAM cell
•	Used parallel PMOS tube as the pre-charge tube and connected all the bit lines as the pre-charge circuit; realized the amplifier by the inverter back-to-back to reduce the charge and discharge duration
•	Enhanced my ability to review literature, raise and resolve problems, as well as the implementation of the chip and the understanding of the circuit

### Circuit and Layout Design of 8-bit Full Adder
Jun. 2021
Independent “Integrated Circuit CAD” Course Project; supervised by Prof. Xiaojin Zhao
•	Staring from the transistor and realized the function of the 8-bit full adder circuit, drew the layout verified by DRC and LVS, as well as optimized the layout area size to the minimum; measured and recorded the critical path
•	Reviewed the CMOS circuit and the entire IC process and consolidated my foundation and technology

### Design of DDS Frequency Synthesizer and Interleaver based on DE10
Apr. 2021 – May. 2021
Independent “Programmable ASIC” Course Project; supervised by Prof. Chunping Liu
•	Conceived the modules of the projects and implemented each module with Verilog HDL, including the key input module, phase accumulation module, waveform output module, and digital tube display module
•	Divided and set up the frequency divider module, the random code generator module, the interleaving function module, and the output module, and realized them with Quartus 13, verilog HDL and DE10 boards

### Evaluation Model for Maintaining Healthy Higher Education Systems, 2021 MCM/ICM F
Feb. 2021                                                                                            
Project Member; Supervised by Prof. Lei Sun, Shenzhen University
•	Selected indicators to measure the health status of a higher education system via literature review 
•	Used AHP analytical hierarchy to construct an evaluation index system and obtained the weight of each index
•	Separated the benefit-oriented and cost-oriented indicators and used the deviation fuzzy matrix method to construct an evaluation model for the higher education system and used it to score the education systems of six countries
•	Validated the model using principal component analysis and factor analysis
•	Extracted three indicators after analyzing the correlation among all the indicators and proposed the improved scheme and recommended values of the indicators
•	Invited the grey prediction model GM (1, 1) to predict the future data and the experimental results showed that the education system under our proposal has been significantly improved
•	Provided more detailed recommendations and timeline, and the sensitivity test of our model showed that the result is very robust; we further discussed the possible impact on the education system from the reality

•	Purchased necessary equipment, such as 51 single-chip microcomputers, sensor module, DuPont line, debugged and assembled the vehicle
•	Tested the angle of the tracking module and increased the sensitivity so that once it is about to deviate from the track, we could adjust the speed of the left and right wheels to get it back in time
•	Changed the turning angle and speed by dynamically adjusting the speed differences between wheels on both sides
•	Successfully implemented an intelligent tracking and obstacle avoidance vehicle, which can drive along the specified track at the maximum speed without obstacles
