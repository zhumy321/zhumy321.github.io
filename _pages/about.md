## About me

> Welcome to this site :smile:. So nice to see you here. My name is ZHU Minyi (ZHU is the family name), and I have also an English name "Irene", which my foreign teachers, classmates and some friends would use to call me. I graduated from Shenzhen University in 2022, majoring in Microelectronics. I am interested in a lot of things, such as speedcubing, amateur radio, music, reading...

## About here

> I built my personal sharing website in 2021 with server and WordPress, the domain name "mango-st-irreg.xyz" and "zhuminyi.xyz" had both been used. But in 2024.4 I started to migrate the website here (with Github pages). If everything goes well, later on I shall update all new sharings here, including things relevant to my life, work, thinking, learning, etc. If these can bring you assistance, spark thoughts, or inspire you, I would feel delighted and honored. but of course if there are any mistakes, feel free to email me, and I would be immensely grateful!

## My works
I'm trying on some and looking forward to bringing them here.
